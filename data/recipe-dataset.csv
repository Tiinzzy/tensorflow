"Prawn Balchao RecipeGoa is a total bliss when it comes to sea food lovers. Most restaurants get their fresh catch every day, which gets showcased right at their entrance. Customers are free to pick and choose from the display, that later gets served at their dinner table. One such dish which I always relish at my favourite restaurant in Goa is the Prawn Balchao. My colleagues love the prawn masala used in this one as the dish is a mixture of sweet, spice and sourness. The unique ingredient that makes the prawn even more delectable is the Goan Toddy Vinegar - one can get this in the Saturday Mapusa Market. Its like the Mecca for all the spices, fresh smoked sausages and pastes that the Goans use in their day to day cooking. There are many variations to this dish, some make it like a semi gravy similar to how this recipe does while others pickle the prawn. But the taste pretty much remains the same no matter the type of preparation, although the later one is more tangier due to the pickling process. Serve hot Prawn Balchao with   or simple rice of your choice with a nice tall glass of chilled beer.

"Brown Rice In Pressure Cooker MethodWhole Rice grains with only hull removed is called brown rice. The brown rice is unpolished and hence has all the nutrition of the bran and germ intact. Whole rice has a mild nutty flavor and this rice is particularly rich in thiamine, a B vitamin and iron. Brown Rice needs double the cooking time than the white rice. All the recipes that include any variety of white rice can be prepared with brown rice. Note that the brown rice is marginally beneficial than white rice and makes very slight difference when you are on weight moderation diets. Rice can be cooked in a variety of ways. Personally I find the pressure cooker method quick and effective that can produce rice grains of different textures - from soft to grainy. There are a number of different types of rice grains available and you might choose the variety that your family has been eating for generations or you might want to try another new variety. Each type of grain, when cooked produces different texture of the rice. The older the rice, the longer it takes to cook. With practice and the depending on the kind of rice you use, you will be able to arrive at the correct water proportion for cooking rice. Thepressure cookermethod and thesaucepan method, both yield different textures of rice. If you like soft sticky rice, then pressure cooker accomplishes that very easily.

Ever since I have left the US and France, I have found it hard to get Dijon Mustard at stores in India, this is when it struck to me to make it at home. All I had to do was phone a friend in France and ask her for a recipe to make it. It was as simple as that.
